ry memory allocator
       - OS v.s. application memory allocation
       - mmaping /dev/zero (not possible in Macs) 
       - slab allocation (memory->caches->slabs)
       


Memory mapping
       - basic operation and example
       - mmap(NULL, PAGE_SIZE, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0); 
       - bitmaps contd. (find_zero_bit)
